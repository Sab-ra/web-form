Another practical VUE excercise with NetNinja!

The statistics of getting front-end developer's job in Ukraine (for 
juniors) is not really promissing. And I think it's not because of poor market 
demand.

Some of well known IT cources in here tell to their students, that they 
didn't need to learn English to become a programer. They say, you rather 
spend a year coding 15 hours a week to get a job.

OMG, I hope you can read it. And I hope you don't belive that crap. 

To become a reliable programmer you got to know English. And you got to 
learn things without translation.

So, follow NetNinja.dev for example. And have fun.

Peace
